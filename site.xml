<!-- This file controls the operation of our little php "cms" system.

Every page must be in a section. Ordering of pages and sections goes in 
the same order as the elements are listed in this file. Name attribute is 
printed to be shown to the user, and id is used to select the page. If no 
id is selected OR a non-existant id is selected, the system will default 
to the first page of the first section of this file. If this file does not 
exist or cannot be read or does not have even one page in even one section, 
the php program will show an error message and quit.
